### Project Objective

This repository contains code designed to process longitudinal data by converting it into a format suitable for analysis. Specifically, the code:

- **Transforms longitudinal data**: Adjusts the structure of the input data to ensure it's in the correct format for further processing.
- **Generates Sankey plots**: Utilizes the transformed data to create Sankey plots, which visually represent the flow and transitions of different entities within the data over time.

This tool aims to facilitate the analysis of longitudinal studies by providing clear, visual representations of data transitions, aiding in the understanding of complex patterns and relationships.
